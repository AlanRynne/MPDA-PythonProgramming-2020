# Install

In order to follow this tutorial, you must have the following software installed.

- VSCode
- Rhinoceros 6 with Grasshopper
- Python 3.x (latest version)
- Rhino-stubs

## VSCode

Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), this will be our text editor of choice.

## Choco / Brew

Choco(Windows)/Brew(Mac) are install managers that will take care of most of the trouble when installing.

A very nice guide to install `brew` can be found [here](http://osxdaily.com/2018/03/07/how-install-homebrew-mac-os/).

To install choco on windows, follow their [install guide](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation#install-with-powershellexe). I heavily recommend using the powershell installation method.

## Python

Once choco / brew has been installed. We can easily install python by running:

```shell
brew install python3
```

or in Windows,

```shell
choco install python3
```
